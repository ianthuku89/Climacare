# Climacare
The Flask application combines climate prediction and chatbot functionalities. 
It loads climate data, cleans it, and trains models to predict temperature and precipitation. 
These models are then used to predict weather conditions in response to user input through the /predict endpoint. 
Additionally, the application manages a chatbot that responds to user messages via the /chat endpoint. 
It logs errors and significant events for debugging purposes.
